# SweetRecipes

Simple mobile app done via React Native, inspired by this framework: https://dribbble.com/shots/8497072-Recipe-App-Design
The purpose of this project is to learn more about React Native and create simple, nice looking app for iOS devices. Design - frameworks, icons and such,
are used with use of Adobe XD and free stock images found online.

At the end _IT SHOULD_ look like this :

Update: 26/06/2020 - 
It's way easier to say what is not working, than what *is* working. Overall, app is offering planned functionality in a basic form - you can pic cakes recipes and not-a-cake recpies thanks to two buttons which are added in the main screen. 

The sidebar thingi is scrapped, but thanks to that I learnt a lot about different navigation form in React Native, which is quite useful.

Pagination between recipes doesn't work as expected - once you went through all of them, pagination doesn't reset itself but shows empty screen.

That's about it I think. 

Also, main screen is a bit of a mess. 

Conclusion: I am a bit bored and tired of this project - it's kind of working as expected and I am not super passionate about it, looks nice enough, so I am leaving as it is.
